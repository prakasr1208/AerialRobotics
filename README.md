To use the DroneKit Python API to communicate with PixHawk 4 controller. The DroneKit API provides us the functionality to communicate without needing to use the MAVLINK protocol. The algorithms written in MATLAB by our team will be converted to Python and custom functions will be built based on the DroneKit class.
